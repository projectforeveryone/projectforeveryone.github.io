      <h1>ðŸ”¬ Lab Research Assistant Scenario</h1>
      <p>
        Youâ€™re a Lab Research Assistant at PFE simulations, working alongside the lead researcher to support a range of experimental simulations. Your primary role is to ensure experiments are set up correctly, equipment is calibrated, and safety protocols are followed throughout. During experiments, you log data in real-time, track key variables, and conduct basic analysis to spot trends or irregularities. After each session, you help dismantle setups, clean and store equipment, and document findings for internal reporting. The goal is to ensure smooth, accurate, and safe execution of lab-based research to support the development of new simulation technologies.

      <h2>Task 1 - Experiment Design</h2>
      <p>
        You have been asked to design a lab experiment to determine how temperature affects the solubility of sugar in water. This should include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hypothesis</li>
        <li>Materials</li>
        <li>Controlled and independent variables</li>
        <li>Method (steps to follow)</li>
        <li>Expected outcome (what trend you expect to observe)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can include sketches for this task</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Task 2 - Lab Safety</h2>
      <p>
        You have been asked to prepare a document where you have to list and explain 3 safety precautions to follow when handling hydrochloric acid during experiments, For each, explain the rationale and any required personal protective equipment (PPE).
      </p>
      <p>*Make sure that the language is understandable as the lab researchers are less experienced.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Task 3 - Data Logging</h2>
        <p>
            You measured solubility (grams of sugar dissolved in 100 ml water) at the following temperatures:
20Â°C - 200g, 40Â°C - 230g, 60Â°C - 270g, 80Â°C - 310g
Organize this into a table and summarize the trend in 2-3 sentences.
