          <h1>üèóÔ∏è Civil Engineering Scenario</h1>
          <p>
            This simulation places participants in the role of a junior civil engineer working on an infrastructure project. It introduces core engineering responsibilities and encourages practical thinking around safety, materials, and construction planning. Designed for early-career learners, the tasks simulate a real-world engineering environment that emphasizes both technical analysis and written communication. In this simulation, participants will be tasked with evaluating a construction site, selecting appropriate materials, and drafting a project report.

          <h2>Task 1 - Load Calculation</h2>
          <p>Task: Calculate the maximum load a simply supported steel I-beam (length 6m, width 150mm, height 300mm) can support, given yield strength of 250 MPa. Assume standard safety factors. Include assumptions and the formula used.</p>
          <h3>Information and Data</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Beam Type: Simply Supported I-Beam.</li>
            <li>Length (L): 6.0 m.</li>
            <li>Cross-section: Rectangular approximation. Width (b): 150 mm (0.15 m) and Height (h): 300 mm (0.30 m).</li>
            <li>Yield Strength of Steel (œÉ<sub>yield</sub>): 250 MPa (250 √ó 10‚Å∂ Pa).</li>
            <li>Yield Strength of Steel (œÉ<sub>yield</sub>): 250 MPa (250 √ó 10‚Å∂ Pa).</li>
          </ul>
            <h3>Assumptions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Beam acts as a simply supported beam with a uniformly distributed load (UDL).</li>
                <li>The cross-section is approximated as a solid rectangle (for simplicity, instead of using actual I-beam properties).</li>
                <li>Neglect beam self-weight (or assume it's already included in the load).</li>
                <li>Material is homogeneous and isotropic (standard for structural steel).</li>
                <li>Plastic deformation begins at the yield point.</li>

        <h2>Task 2 - Project Proposal</h2>
        <p>As part of your internship, you‚Äôve been asked to assist in drafting a concise project proposal for a pedestrian bridge over a small canal that links a residential area to a local park. The bridge will serve both practical commuting needs and recreational use. Your proposal will be reviewed by your engineering supervisor and potentially forwarded to local council stakeholders.
            
        Your goal is to summarize the key project elements in a format suitable for a non-technical audience, while still demonstrating basic engineering understanding and planning awareness.</p>

        <h3>Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Project Overview: Briefly describe the purpose and benefits of the bridge.</li>
            <li>Design Considerations: Discuss materials, safety features, and environmental impact.</li>
            <li>Site Considerations: Summarize key aspects such as soil type, water level changes, and accessibility for construction vehicles.</li>
            <li>Budget Estimate: Provide a rough cost estimate for materials and labor.</li>
            <li>Timeline: Outline a basic project timeline from design to completion.</li>
            <li>Conclusion: Summarize the importance of the project and its expected impact on the community.</li>

        <div class="container">
        <h2>Task 3 - Site Plan Review</h2>
        <p>Following up with your project proposal, the engineering supervisor has some queries regarding the key risks of your project proposal. Analyse and explain the key risks in the project proposal and methods to mitigate these risks. (keep word count between 150-200 words for this task)</p>
